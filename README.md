# What You Know
misc. proverbs for developers

Developer things you know that you know even if you don't know why you know that...

- the easiest code to develop is no code at all. Most companies should NOT be developing code anymore than they would design their own office buildings, parking lots and electrical distribution systems.
- agile development just hides the mess you just made somewhere else and is a huge contributer to very low quality products
- agile development changes the ill-advised practice of fantasy arbitrary deadlines into a formalism of fixed (and therefore arbitrary) deadlines
- agile development is an example of non-scientific anecdotal social uptake of development methodologies by hordes of non-science based "programmers" who simply don't understand the concept of scientific bias and how it applies to their own perceived socially comfortable assumptions
- adding people to a late software project makes it later. an absolute truth that periodically gets fogotten and then rediscovered, and surprisingly stays just plain forgotten in many organizations.
- managing programmers is like herding cats. an absolute truth that is so inconvenient to socially acceptable business processes that it gets purposely forgotten. Businesses that understand the concept of "managing Talent" (such as film and music) understand the difference between Talent and people that other companies just label "resources" (people as interchangeable widgets) in their project management programs.
- calling the complex Art of Programming some variation of "Engineering" and labeling programmers "Engineers" is both stupid and a disservice to real Engineers everywhere. The origin of this unfortunate recent social meme is probably startup culture seeking to reassure the stock market but misguided perversions like that have a habit of taking on a life of their own...
